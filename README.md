Utilizing Power BI to display for a consulting company, Hertz hires you to make certain data driven decisions.

The main product of this report is the Power BI dashboard. Interactive dashboard focuses on various projects for rent a car analysis. This company wants to see that Which car makes and models are popular and in which cities, What are the most expensive cities for car rentals, What is the typical fare  of car rental in various major cities and so on.

The dashboard features:

- Tesla Model3 are the most popular car.  Average cost per day $145.21 which is over than general average $93.69. Nowadays, people turned to rent battery power vehicles it might be another reason. 
- Biggest cities bring the most population therefore, CA has the largest population so, we can say that California uses the maximum number of cars.
- Miami is the most expensive city because of the demand for luxury car cars. Who goes to Miami majority of people rented luxury car so, it makes Miami the most expensive city.
- Lamborghini and Rolls Royce make the maximum daily rate which helps company to make most average daily rate. They are not the most popular but brings the most money.
- There is correlation between rental cost per day and trips taken. If the daily cost is less then it will be a greater number of trips otherwise, it will be less trips taken.
-  Most cars in the market are based on gasoline. But electric car brings more money to company.
